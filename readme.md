ðŸŒŸ Dynamic Digital Clock with Light and Dark Mode ðŸŒ™

Iâ€™ve built a dynamic digital clock using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. This clock not only displays the current time but also allows users to switch between light and dark modes. Here are the key features:


Time Display: The clock shows the current time in a clear and easy-to-read format.

Light Mode: By default, the clock is in light mode, which has a bright background and dark text.

Dark Mode: Users can toggle to dark mode, which features a dark background and light text. Perfect for nighttime!

Code Available: Iâ€™ve shared the complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for this project. You can find it here: .git
